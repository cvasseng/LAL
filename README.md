***This is my old C++ Lua binding library. It was originally written in 2008, and is added here mostly as a "sentimental backup".***

# LAL

LAL (Lua Abstraction Library - super creative) was originally written in 2008.
It was used for several projects over a couple of years, including in an unreleased PS3 title. 

I'm not sure if this is the latest version or not. It's the only copy I could find, but I could find no verification on its relative freshness. I remember that earlier versions had a few memory problems, and bugs dealing with tables. These were fixed, but again - I don't know if these fixes are in this snapshot or not. If it *is* the latest version, it should be pretty stable and is well-tested. If it's *not* the latest version, there are some potential serious issues with it. In either case, there are much much better alternatives out there these days, but it may still be useful as a reference for those not using any bind libraries.

There's an ancient version of Lua bundled in the repository, I didn't dare trying to replace it with a newer version before pushing.

Check out the samples in the samples directory to see what the interface looks like.
